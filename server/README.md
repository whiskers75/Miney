 Custom LAN Ports by CptHunter 
Website
This mod allows for you to enter a custom port, IP, and MOTD! I did not stop there. I saw the opportunity to add more features, and I did. Now you can edit almost everything you could edit on a normal, vanilla, server! I also added some basic options to get your LAN feeling a bit more like a real server. It’s like starting a server, but with your own Single Player worlds, and with your own Single Player mods.

v52.1.6

This is a block that loads chunks. There is a limit on the number of chunks each non-op player can load in SMP, and each chunk loader can load an adjustable area.

 EnderStorage by Ecu/chicken_bones 
Website
EnderStorage is a mod that offers a means to store your items in The END, causing them to be everywhere and nowhere at the same time. All EnderStorage makes use of the magic of colors to link storage with its little piece of The END. Any EnderStorage with the same color code share inventory (even across dimensions). Currently there are two types of storage, EnderChest and EnderPouch.

v1.115.208
 
 Industrial Craft 2 by Alblaka & IC2 Team 
Website
This is it. IC2, the future of IC. While playing it, you will feel right at home again, rediscovering most of the stuff known from IC. However, once you get your machines running, you will quickly notice how smooth and well-designed everything works now. Wiring is easier, batterys aren’t as twosided (on/off) anymore, new cables, rubber stuff, new machines, EVERYTHING was added. Create obstacle courses of Metal Poles and Rubber-Sheets, explore the Nether with an Electrical Jetpack or blow up whole landscapes at once by using the Dynamite-O-Mote. Or discover the much more complex mechanisms of Nuclear Engineering, blow up your hut or burn your hands. Or grab the rusty ol Composite Vest, and start hunting Creepers with the new, allmighty NanoSaber.

v52.2.4
 
 Immibis Core by immibis 
Website
Core mod required for immibis mods

v1.50
 
 Inventory Tweaks by Jimeowan

v4.5.4.217
 
 Iron Chests by cpw 
Website
IronChests adds several new chests to the game. One for each type of metal. You can even upgrade them!

v2.0.8
 
 MineFactory Reloaded by Powercrystals 
Website
A way to automatically farm plants and animals, as well some new rail tracks! With this mod you can set up a completely automated farm for any of these things that requires no real work aside from collecting the harvests and reloading the planter, without incredibly complex and unwieldy water/piston solutions. And you can milk cows to death or otherwise run livestock farms if you need those resources. Oh and it has conveyor belts too.

v0.9.5.00

v1.4.5.1
 
 Not Enough Items by chicken_bones 
Website
NEI is a successor to both Too Many Items and Recipe Book. It arose around the same time as Craft Guide when Alexandria and a few others on the IRC suggested that I merge both Too Many Items and Recipe Book to remove their greatest flaws, ironically too many items, or in the case of recipe book, too many recipies. Too Many Items was great, but the one thing it lacked was an easy way to search and sort your items. When you had a mod like Red Power coming along with 10000 items both TMI and Recipe Book were racking up the pages. Even if you don’t want to use NEI for cheating in items, you will likely feel right at home with the Recipe component of the mod.

 Nether Ores by Powercrystals

Website
v2.2.0
 
 Thermal Expansion by KingLemmingCoFH 
Website
Thermal Expansion, at its core, is a ‘tech’ mod - it’s a mod of what ifs. For example, what if you could turn water into ice or snow with a machine? Or how about a machine that could combine lava and water however you choose? What if there were a wool that didn’t burn? Or, what if you could set up advanced yet extremely compact production chains that didn’t require redstone engines or complex pipe routing? If any of that interests you, then you may want to check this out.

v1.4.6.r03
 
 Treecapitator by 
Website
v52.1.2
 
 Tube Stuff by immibis 
Website
This is a small mod that adds two new blocks that I thought were missing, related to BuildCraft and RedPower. It’s called TubeStuff because I don’t have a better name - feel free to suggest one. The buffer could also use a less generic name.

v0.2.0.42
 
 Modular Power Suits by MachineMuse 
Website
MachineMuse’s Modular Powersuits is a mod based around the idea of an inventor who tinkers with high-tech electronics and makes a suit of powered armor chock-full of useful gadgets and features. Inspired by heroes like Iron Man, Megaman, and Samus Aran, as well as by the high-tech armor in other mods like EE2 and IC2.

v1.3.2.4
 
 Wireless Redstone Chicken Bones Edition by chicken_bones 
Website
In its simplest this is a mod that allows you to transmit your redstone state wirelessly. Even if you dont use redstone this mod could still be for you. Found an awesome landscape you’d like to mark, a cool cave to explore, or keep losing your way from base to base? Ever wished that compass pointed somewhere else or there was a way to mark things on a map. Well now there is. With the wireless addons component of this mod you can use wireless signals for navigation.
